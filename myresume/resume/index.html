             <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>My Name is Carlos Lorenzo and I want to start by saying something unique about me. One out of many unique things about me is that I'm a very creative person
                and I enjoy asking myself questions of new things that i'd like to learn. There was this one time that when I was in 7th grade one of my class mates know how 
                to solve a full 6 sided rubix cube. I was amazed that someone at my age knew how to solve the rubix cube. I had only seen professionals solve it. So I was curious 
                and decided to try it out myself. The only problem was that I didnt know how to begin to solve it. So I wasked my friend who had one of those cubes and asked her if 
                I could use it. Soon with alot of practice and detication, Ilearned to solve one side of the cube. I was excited to solve one part of the cube put deep inside I wasn't 
                satisfied with my accomplishment. I wanted to solve all six sides of the cube in order to show people that I to could solve the rubix cube. But I had another problem, 
                during my time I didnt have a smart phone or a device that could help me search the internet for tutorial on how to solve the cube. So knowing that I had this small obstacle
                I was still determined to solve the cube. I asked my classmate who knew how to solve the rubix cube and asked her to teach me. Unfortanetly she refused to teach me because
                if I knew how to solve it then it wouldn't that amazing anymore since it would mean that she wouldn't be the smartest in the class. So I turned around and decided to use other 
                resources at my disposal. I went to my nearest public library and search for how to solve the rubix cube. I then hit a second obstacle. The books that showed a tutorial were 
                to diffult for me to understand. I wasn't a smart kid who would read all the time but I still wanted to know how to solve the cube. I had lost the this battle but not the war. 
                Years later I was in a coding program called teens exploring tech, where I met many other talented students that were learning to code and become good leaders. As we went 
                further in the program I saw that one of the students knew how to solve the rubix, the bestpart was that he did it in under 3 minutes. Shockingly I asked him how he had 
                learned to solve the rubix cube so fast. He sent me a link that shows the best tutorial on how to solve the rubix cube. So determinly again I decided to give it another try. 
                I watched the tutorial multiple times and surprisingly it wasn't so hard to learn but it did take a lot of practice. If I wanted to become as fast as that student I needed 
                to practice more. I practiced and practiced untill finally, I did it. I was able to solve all six sides of the cube in under 3 minutes my fastest time so far is 2 minutes
                and 35 seconds. That day I was proud of myself because even though I stopped trying I was able to try again and finish my goal. It took me a total of 2 days to perfectly 
                learn to the solve the cube, this was for sure one of, my many accomplishments.

            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>I am an organize and I like to be on time. I like to work in groups and be able to help out. I'm a visual learner so whenever I see someone teaching something to me its easier for me 
                to understand, same way around I like to teach people by showing what I mean because I feel like they also would learn better if they see an example. I dont like to cheat nor steal because its dishonest
                and I was raised to not steal nor cheat. This has helped me in school and in my daily life because it means that I could stay out of trouble. One of my favortie skills is that I like to create things like 
                legos, origami, or solve a rubix cube which isnt building something but you build expertise. I am skilled in speaking two languages, im able to translate for my parents whnever they need me to translate 
                and its usedfull becuase it means that i'm able to communicate to twice as many people.

            <h3>Experience</h3>        
            <p> I have many experiences in failure which has helped me because i'm able to avoid making those fails again. Based on my experience of math I'm able to calculate and be on time to 
                important meetings. I have alot of experience on talking in 2 languages because I talk in spanish at home and english at school. Since I know two languages im able to talk to twice as many people. 
                I like to say that I have some experience in coding because I was able to create an app out of scratch and present it live with other people and work with other 4 amazing highschool students. I have experience in participating in 
                big events, like tae kwon do tournmnet which is martial arts. I have experience running a marathon twice which helps alot with other activites in terms of not giving. Running a marathon means to keep pushing and being
                determined to cross the finish line.
