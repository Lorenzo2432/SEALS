        <p>The way I would describe my creativity is by showing an image of an origami because when I have work to do I do them
            one step at a time so that at the end its all form up like the origami star. To make an origmai you have to fold it step
            by step so you could get a cool origami figure. I also chose the image because it's one of my favorite origami shapes 
            I like to make.

        <p>This week I learned that css is basically the way the webstie is going to look like. In css I could change the background color,
            change fonts, and move the images around the website. This week I felt like I understoond the lesson and wanted to try out use the 
            knowledge I learned and put in good use. I was able to add a background color which I didn't know how to do before. I was able to 
            move my image to center of the page which was one of my main struggles from last year, but thats not the case this year. One thing
            I want to learn next session is how to add a gif or a video into my website.
